        <h2 class="mb-4" style="font-size: 34px; text-transform: capitalize;"> About Me </h2>
        <p>I'm currently a freshman computer
            science student at Western Michigan University.
            I am excited to learn more about computer science,
            and eventually work in the field. I am particularly
            interested in computer programming and AI.
            <br> <br>I was born and raised in Ethiopia, where
            I also discovered a deep passion for sweet coffee
            and a strong interest in how technology influences
            human behaviour. People from unique places and
            my own experiences outside of work both readily
            inspire me.</p>
